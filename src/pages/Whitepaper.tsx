        "For eons, the Omniverse‚Äîthe vast, infinite expanse of all existence‚Äîremained a complex, yet stable, tapestry. The Twelve Prime Realms were the anchors, the most diverse and powerful worlds, each a pillar of reality.",
        "These realms, while vastly different in physics, magic, and culture, were separated by the Veil of Aethel, an impenetrable boundary that prevented unchecked, catastrophic inter-dimensional travel.",
        "The guardian of this Veil and the balance of the Omniverse was the Aethel-Core, a cosmic artifact of pure creation energy, housed deep within the legendary Nexus City."

      title: "üí• The Calamity: The Void Scar",
      content: [
        "A year ago, a rogue cosmic entity known only as the Chasm-Lord launched a devastating, surprise attack. The target was the Aethel-Core itself.",
        "Though the Chasm-Lord was ultimately repelled and sealed away, the damage was irreversible. The Aethel-Core shattered.",
        "The resulting cosmic explosion‚Äîknown now as the Void Scar‚Äîdidn't destroy the worlds, but it ripped holes in the Veil of Aethel. Twelve Great Tears opened up, one directly above each of the Twelve Prime Realms."

      title: "‚ú® The Echoes of the Nexus",
      content: [
        "The fragments of the Aethel-Core didn't vanish; they were scattered. Twelve Major Fragments, each imbued with a sliver of the Core's power, were forcefully drawn through the Tears and crashed into the Prime Realms.",
        "These fragments acted as metaphysical magnets, drawing the attention of the realms' greatest heroes.",
        "An Echo‚Äîa faint, psychic projection from the shattered Core‚Äîbegan to call out to the most worthy individual in each of the Twelve Realms. These chosen are the Nexus Echoes."

      title: "ü¶∏ The Chosen Heroes",
      content: [
        "Each of the Twelve Heroes was not merely a champion, but the one individual whose destiny, innate power, or unique connection to their realm's energy was compatible with the Aethel-Core's residual energy.",
        "Upon making contact with the Major Fragment in their world, they were instantly teleported to the ruins of Nexus City‚Äîthe epicenter of the disaster, now existing in a liminal space between all worlds.",
        "They are strangers, suddenly standing side-by-side, forced to communicate across barriers of language, technology, and understanding."
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "‚ö†Ô∏è The Immediate Threat",
      content: [
        "The Shattering had a disastrous side effect: Reality Bleed. Minor dimensional cracks are opening randomly across the Prime Realms, leaking hostile creatures, chaotic magic, and unstable energies from lesser, dying dimensions.",
        "If the Aethel-Core is not reformed, the uncontrolled Reality Bleed will accelerate, leading to the eventual collapse and merger of all Twelve Prime Realms into a single, chaotic, and uninhabitable wasteland."

      title: "üéØ The Quest",

        "Restore the Core: Recover the Twelve Major Fragments from each of their home realms‚Äîa journey that will take them back and forth through the Great Tears.",
        "Seal the Void Scar: Use the restored Aethel-Core to close the greatest Tear and repair the Veil before the Omniverse is consumed by chaos.",
        "The clock is ticking. The Nexus Echoes are the last hope for the infinite reality."
